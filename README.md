Project Wish List
====================

Welcome to Project Wish List!
Project Wish List is a simple, collaborative way for groups to organize all their wish lists in one place.
Group members can view each other's wish lists, claim items, and edit their own wish list. All while maintaining the secrecy
of who has bought what.

## How to Run

Requirements:
1. Make sure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) installed.

Running:
1. Fork this repository and clone your fork.
2. Navigate to the root directory `wishlist` and run `go get`.
3. Build the application using `go build`.
4. Run the resulting binary to begin serving on `localhost:8080`.

## Play Around!

Visit your locally running server and sign into the demo session **OG Wish List**.

Use any of the following case sensitive usernames to sign in:
- Dre
- Snoop
- Tupac
- Warren G
- Nate Dogg

For the demo session, the password is irrelevant. Feel free to add, edit, and remove items from your own list, or claim and unclaim items in other lists.
